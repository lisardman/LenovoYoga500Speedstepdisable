# LenovoYoga500Speedstepdisable
fixes broken speedstepping on the Lenovo Yoga 500 and makes it usable and the cpu don't get stuck in 0.5GHz

Lenovo Yoga 500:s get broken in hardware and makes the computer unusable.  But this script that I copied or made back in the day fixes that problem.  Add it to crontab or create a services that runs it and it will make your computer work. 

Tested out in Ubuntu 23.10
